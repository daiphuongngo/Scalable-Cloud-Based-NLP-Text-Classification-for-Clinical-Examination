## Project Objective:

Building a real-time Natural Language Processing feedback processing platform using **Python, PySpark, SQL** integrated with **AWS SageMaker, Redshift, Glue, GCP Vertex AI, BigQuery**, supporting Doctor to determine medical specialties for patients.

## Dataset:

Medical Transacriptions

Context

Medical data is extremely hard to find due to HIPAA privacy regulations. This dataset offers a solution by providing medical transcription samples.

Content

This dataset contains sample medical transcriptions for various medical specialties.

Acknowledgements

This data was scraped from mtsamples.com

Inspiration

Can you correctly classify the medical specialties based on the transcription text?
